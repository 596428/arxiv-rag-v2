These models utilize crowdsourced data with local environmental features to enhance prediction accuracy across both indoor at elevation and outdoor urban settings. They achieve RMSE performance of 9.76 to 11.69 dB for RSRP, 2.90 to 3.23 dB for RSRQ, and 9.50 to 10.36 dB for RSSI, evaluated on over 300,000 data points in the Toronto, M...",

Since normalizing flows offer a full predictive distribution instead of a point forecast, they facilitate direct usage of known heuristics for AL like Entropy or Least-Confident sampling. However, we show that most of these heuristics do not work well for normalizing flows in pool-based AL and we need more sophisticated algorithms to distingu...",
